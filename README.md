# About
The primary goal of OMOBA (Open Multiplayer Mobile Battler Arena) is to operate as an open-source project, enabling various users to participate in the development process. The core idea is to launch a game under the OMOBA organization, with all profits being automatically distributed among all contributors. Additionally, OMOBA aims to establish an open market where anyone can design a character and offer it on the game market either for free or at a set price. Options include lifetime ownership, selling a limited number of items, or providing unlimited offeringsâ€”opening up a realm of infinite possibilities. In terms of modern technologies, this is a DAO that utilizes NFT contracts for assets and cryptocurrency as in-game tokens for accessing special features.

We plan to use the GPL license for this project but are open to discussions to refine and enhance this foundational concept. Our vision is to create a powerful, visionary project where everyone can engage in the creative process and earn profits when their contributions are utilized.
